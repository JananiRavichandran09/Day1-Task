# Node Task 1

## NodeJS 

 + Node.js is an *open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment* that allows developers to `run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.`
 + It is designed to be **efficient and scalable**, making it well-suited for `building server-side` and `networked applications.`
 + **Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine,** the same engine that powers Google Chrome, and it uses a `non-blocking,` event-driven architecture that makes it ideal for handling *asynchronous tasks* and I/O operations.

## Using Inbuilt Functions

  + fs.writeFileSync(filePath,timeStamp,'utf8')
